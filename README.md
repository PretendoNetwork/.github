* PRUDP/NEX was originally designed and developed by [Quazal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ubisoft_subsidiaries#Quazal)
* Huge thanks to [Kinnay](https://github.com/Kinnay) as without his reverse engineering work and documentation of PRUDP and NEX, we doubt Pretendo would be anywhere today.
